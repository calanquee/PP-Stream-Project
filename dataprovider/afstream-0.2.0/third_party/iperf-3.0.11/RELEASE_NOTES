== iperf 3.0.11 2015-01-09 ==

* User-visible changes

  * Added -1 / --one-off flag, which causes the iperf3 server to
    process one client connection and then exit.  Intended primarily
    for bwctl integration (issue #230).

  * Added various minor bug fixes (issues #231, #232, #233).

  * Added 30-second timeout for UDP tests if unable to establish UDP
    connectivity between sender and receiver (issue #222).

== iperf 3.0.10 2014-12-16 ==

* User-visible changes

  * Fixed the build on MacOS X Yosemite (issue #213).

  * UDP tests now honor the -w option for setting the socket buffer
    sizes (issue #219).

* Developer-visible changes

  * Added an RPM spec file plus functionality to fill in the version
    number.

  * Fixed potential filename collision with a system header (issue
    #203).

== iperf 3.0.9 2014-10-14 ==

* User-visible changes

  * Fixed a series of problems that came from attempting a UDP test
    with a pathologically large block size.  This put the server into
    an odd state where it could not accept new client connections.
    This in turn caused subsequent client connections to crash when
    interrupted (issue #212).

* Developer-visible changes

  * None.

== iperf 3.0.8 2014-09-30 ==

* User-visible changes

  * Updated license and copyright verbage to confirm to LBNL Tech
    Transfer requirements.  No substantive changes; license remains
    the 3-clause BSD license.

* Developer-visible changes

  * None.

== iperf 3.0.7 2014-08-28 ==

* User-visible changes

  * A server bug where new connections from clients could disrupt
    running tests has been fixed (issue #202).

  * Rates now consistently use 1000-based prefixes (K, M, G), where
    sizes of objects now consistently use 1024-based prefixes (issue #173).

  * UDP tests with unlimited bandwidth are now supported (issue #170).

  * An interaction between the -w and -B options, which kept them from
    working when used together, has been fixed (issue #193).

* Developer-visible changes

== iperf 3.0.6 2014-07-28 ==

* User-visible changes

  * Several bugs that kept the -B option from working in various
    circumstances have been fixed (issue #193).

  * Various compatibility fixes for OpenBSD (issue #196) and
    Solaris (issue #177).

* Developer-visible changes

  * The {get,set}_test_bind_address API calls have been added to
    expose the -B functionality to API consumers (issue #197).

== iperf 3.0.5 2014-06-16 ==

* User-visible changes

  * Erroneous output when doing --json output has been fixed (this
    problem was caused by an attempt to fix issue #158).

  * The maximum test running time has been increased from one hour to
    one day (issue #166).

  * Project documentation has been moved to GitHub Pages at this URL:
    http://software.es.net/iperf/.

  * A bug that caused CPU time to be computed incorrectly on FreeBSD
    has been fixed.

  * A timing issue which caused measurement intervals to be wrong
    with TCP tests on lossy networks has been fixed (issue #125).

  * Newer versions of autoconf / automake / libtool are now used by
    default (issue #161).

  * JSON output now indicates whether the test was run in --reverse
    mode (issue #167).

  * It is now possible to get (most of) the server-side output at
    the client by using the --get-server-output flag (issue #160).

* Developer-visible changes

  * automake/autoconf/libtool have been updated to more recent
    versions.  AM_MAINTAINER_MODE is now used to avoid requiring these
    tools at build-time.

== iperf 3.0.4 was not released ==

== iperf 3.0.3 2014-03-26 ==

* User-visible changes

  * Due to several oversights, the source code archive for iperf 3.0.2
    was distributed as an uncompressed tarball, despite having an
    extension (".tar.gz") that indicated it was compressed.  The
    release generation procedure has been changed to avoid this
    problem going forward.

  * Summary structures in the JSON output are now included, even if
    there is only one stream.  This change makes consuming the JSON
    output easier and more consistent (issue #151).

  * A possible buffer overflow in iperf_error.c has been fixed (issue
    #155).

* Developer-visible changes

  * Example programs now build correctly, after having been broken in
    the 3.0.2 release (issue #152).

== iperf 3.0.2 2014-03-10 ==

* User-visible changes

  * The iperf3 project has been moved to GitHub, and various URLs in
    documentation files have been changed to point there.

  * iperf3 now builds on Linux systems that do not support
    TCP_CONGESTION.  Most notably this allows iperf3 to work on CentOS
    5.

  * An abort on MacOS 10.9 has been fixed (issue #135).

  * Added -I flag for the server to write a PID file, mostly useful for
    daemon mode (issue #120).

  * A bug that could break some TCP tests on FreeBSD has been fixed.

  * TCP snd_cwnd output is now printed by default on Linux (issue #99).

  * In JSON output, the --title string no longer has a colon and two
    spaces appended (issue #139).

  * A buffer for holding formatted numeric values is now
    properly-sized so that output is not truncated (issue #142).

* Developer-visible changes

  * Some memory leaks have been fixed.

  * A -d flag enables debugging output.

  * A .gitignore file has been added.

  * libtoolize is now invoked correctly from the bootstrap.sh script.

  * The test unit format can now be set from the API (issue #144).

  * libiperf is now built as both shared and static libraries.

  * In the JSON output, the "connection" structures are now stored as
    an array in the "start" block, instead of overwriting each other.
    While technically an incompatible API change, the former behavior
    generated unusable JSON.
